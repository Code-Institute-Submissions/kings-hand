# Development process
  + I wanted to keep the website colorfully simple, so I decided on grey which reminds of modern tattoo ink.
  + A lot of time was spent making website responsive on all screen sizes.
  + Initially I made services page but because there was not too much material to dedicate entire page to it, I decided to delete it. All services content fitted into cards in index.html.
  + I needed to add second (smaller) hero image because on smaller screens big hero image was 70% outsde the screen.
  + 'Gallery' & 'Reviews' sections contain bootstrap class .card as that layout fitted what I imagined those two sections to be.
  + 'About' section on index has several paragraphs that become hidden as the screen size gets smaller. This is to save real estate area.
  + Video is uploaded because I had issues linking to it remotely while developing the website.

# Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

+   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - Results:
	+ [Index](/assets/readme-files/testing/index-html.png)
	+ [Gallery](/assets/readme-files/testing/gallery-html.png)
	+ [Contact](/assets/readme-files/testing/contact-html.png)
	+ [About](/assets/readme-files/testing/about-html.png)

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

+   #### Niche User Goals

    1. As someone who wants to cover-up an old tattoo, I want to see some of his previous cover-up work and maybe see some testimonials.

        + The user would see sectioned gallery where he can see cover-up examples, as well as reviews from happy customers.

    2. As someone interested in tattoo but undecisive, I want to see testimonials, and want to see the tattoing process.

        + The user can easily see testimonials on home page and video showing tattoing process start to finish in gallery section.

    3. As someone who wants to remove an old tattoo, I want to see some of his previous work and technologies used for tattoo removal.
        + The user can easily see gallery and section specific to tattoo removals. Services section also contains helpful links and info on technology used in tattoo removal.

+   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the salon.

        + Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with "gallery" and "contact" shortcuts.
        + The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        + The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the salon.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        + The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what salon users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        + The user can read the About Us and see some testimonials.
        + The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer, as well as section on bottom of index page.
    4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily see some of their work and contact them for consultations.
        + Top of the index page contains both "gallery" and "contact" links for immediate call to action.

+   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to quickly contact them for follow-up appointment.

        + Navigation has bordered shortcut to quick and easy contact form.
        + Hero image also contains link to contact page, and social media links can be found throughout the page.

### Further Testing

+   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
+   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Ultrawide, Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhoneX.
+   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

### Known Bugs

+	Images in about us page appear a bit out of alignment with text on mobile sizes.
+	Text-area in contact form on contact page is relatively small because if left bigger, it wouldn't stay inside container on mobile and would expand outside the screen.
+   Carousel indicators for gallery & reviews section on index.html are hidden because they overlaped with photos on smaller screen.
